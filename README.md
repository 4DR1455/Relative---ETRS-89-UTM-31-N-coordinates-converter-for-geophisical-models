# Relative-->ETRS-89-UTM-31-N-coordinates-converter-for-geophysical-models
This is a program that calculates the ETRS-89, UTM-31 N coordinates of a geophysical model based on the ETRS-89, UTM-31 N coordinates of the electrodes at the measurement  moment. This is a program developed on demand by ICGC, it aims to make it easier to process data from measurements.

To use it: Download rempoitory, execute with your python interpreter the Interface.py document. You must have two CSV documents: one for electrode data, and one for model elements data. The program will tell you how to format them.
